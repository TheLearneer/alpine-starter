# Best Practices for API designing

Almost every website today uses some API. So it is very very important to properly design and implement APIs.

## Create a blog

Open a terminal an run the following command:

```bash
npx nuxi@latest init -t themes/alpine
```

## Dependencies

Next, go to to `my-blog/` directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

Start the development server on port 3000:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Next, you can start creating your content in Markdown in the `content/` directory.


## Deploy

### Static hosting

You can deploy Alpine to any static hosting by running the following command:

```bash
npm run generate
```

This command will create a `dist/` directory with the compiled files ready to be uploaded to any static hosting.

### Edge platforms

Alpine supports deploying to the following platforms with **zero configuration**:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
- [and more...](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/deploy/presets#supported-hosting-providers)

### Node server

You can deploy Alpine to a Node server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will create a `.output/` directory with the compiled files ready to be uploaded to any Node server.

To start the production server, run the following command:

```bash
node .output/server/index.mjs
```
